Welcome to CodeDay Labs! We have placed you together in a team, here is the project description:

**NEXT STEPS:**

- **Mentors:** Can you please send a When2meet (or other calendar scheduling link) for the first meeting?
- **Students:** (1) introduce yourself, (2) [log into your dashboard](https://labs.codeday.org/dash) to view your assignments for onboarding week, (3) start taking to your teammates to decide on a work session schedule.
